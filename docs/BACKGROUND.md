# R*bert

## Background

Perhaps you've heard about OSS tools like Dependabot, Snyk, OpenRewrite.  Maybe you've even researched and experimented with commercial editions like Moderne or Spring Application Advisor.

These tools are great for upgrading the dependencies your applications rely on.  And the commercial editions mentioned will even help resolve breaking API changes sometimes introduced by version upgrades.  But there are limits.

Subscription offerings like: Github Copilot, Codeium, Tabnine, CodeWhisperer, Gemini CodeAssist are also worth considering.

R*bert taps into the corpus of knowledge continuing to evolve in LLMs and employs carefully constructed prompts to refactor slices of Java source code.
